# Intelligence Journey 🚀  
**My learning journey in Python, Data Science, and AI Engineering — Colab notebooks with organized notes, examples & problem solutions.**  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  

Each topic is organized into its own folder, and every folder contains two notebooks:  

- `*-topic.ipynb` → Notes, explanations, and examples  
- `*-solutions.ipynb` → Practice problems (15–20 questions per topic)
---

## 📖 What’s Inside  

- 📘 **Concept notebooks** — notes, explanations, and coding examples  
- 📝 **Solutions notebooks** — problem sets with step-by-step solutions  
- 🗂️ **Organized folders** — each topic is separated for clarity and progression  

---

## 🚀 How to Use  

- Browse to any topic folder  
- Open notebooks directly in **Google Colab** (or Jupyter)  
- Learn concepts from the `*-topic.ipynb`  
- Practice with the `*-solutions.ipynb`
